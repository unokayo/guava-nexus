# Guava Nexus

Guava Nexus is an experimental system for anchoring authorship,
versioning, and lineage of structured ideas using public ledgers
and off-chain storage.

Guava Nexus provides cryptographic provenance for ideas, allowing authors to anchor authorship, version history, and lineage across notes, drafts, and derived works.

Guava Nexus exists to give execution memory a semantic counterpart — so ideas, claims, and narratives can persist, evolve, and be understood across time without relying on central authority.

Blockchains produce capsules of irreversible time.
Guava Nexus gives those moments context — filling the gaps not with transactions, but with evolving ideas, claims, and narratives.

This repository contains the v0 implementation.

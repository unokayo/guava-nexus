# Guava Nexus — Semantic Primitive

## 1. What is a Seed?

A **Seed** is an authored semantic object.

It is an assertion made by a person (or identity), at a specific moment in time, that can evolve without erasing its prior forms. A Seed has authorship, temporal anchoring, and optional lineage to other Seeds, but it does not require agreement, validation, or finality.

A Seed is not content frozen in time.  
It is meaning allowed to persist, change, and relate—without being overwritten.

## 2. The Problem Guava Nexus Solves

Modern systems preserve **execution memory**, not **semantic memory**.

Blockchains are excellent at remembering:
- what happened
- in what order
- under which rules
- with irreversible finality

They answer:
- *What executed?*
- *What state changed?*

They do **not** preserve:
- why an action was taken
- what idea motivated it
- how understanding evolved
- what disagreements existed at the time

Execution memory overwrites meaning with outcomes.

Human systems fail in the opposite way:
- documents preserve narratives but lose traceability
- platforms optimize engagement but erase intent
- reputation systems collapse nuance into scores
- moderation enforces finality where evolution is needed

What is missing is **semantic memory**: a way to preserve evolving meaning without requiring truth, authority, or consensus.

Guava Nexus exists to give semantic memory a first-class, composable structure.

## 3. What Semantic Memory Is (and Is Not)

Semantic memory is **not**:
- truth
- moderation
- consensus
- storage for its own sake
- a reputation or scoring system

Semantic memory **is** the ability to preserve:
- who asserted what
- when they asserted it
- in relation to which prior assertions
- how that assertion evolved over time

Semantic memory is:
- additive, not overwriting
- tolerant of disagreement
- tolerant of duplication
- structured, but non-final

Guava Nexus does not decide meaning.  
It preserves the conditions under which meaning exists and evolves.

## 4. Execution Memory vs Semantic Memory

A blockchain block is an **execution capsule**:
- immutable
- ordered
- expensive
- blind to meaning

Guava Nexus does not attempt to store meaning inside blocks.

Instead:
- blocks anchor time and existence
- Seeds anchor authorship and semantic lineage

Execution memory and semantic memory are **parallel layers**, not substitutes.

The chain decides *that something was said*.  
Guava Nexus preserves *what was meant and how it evolved*.

---

## 5. Versioning as Narrative, Not Correction

Guava Nexus versioning is **not Git-style deprecation**.

Earlier versions are not “wrong.”  
Later versions do not invalidate prior ones.

Each version is an episode in a narrative:
- earlier versions preserve original intent
- later versions add context, refinement, or divergence
- evolution is visible, not destructive

Meaning is allowed to mature without being rewritten.

---

## 6. Duplication Is Signal, Not Failure

Guava Nexus does not prevent duplication.

In semantic systems:
- sameness is never exact
- context matters
- authorship matters
- timing matters
- lineage matters

Most platforms respond to duplication by enforcing:
- canonical versions
- moderator authority
- final truth

Guava Nexus instead contextualizes similarity.

The system does not say:
> “This already exists. Stop.”

It says:
> “Related assertions exist. Here is how they connect.”

Duplication becomes structure, not noise.

---

## 7. What Guava Nexus Deliberately Does Not Do

To preserve its role as infrastructure, Guava Nexus explicitly does **not**:
- determine truth
- block or suppress claims
- rank ideas by authority or popularity
- enforce consensus
- act as a moderation system
- collapse meaning into reputation

If these invariants break, Guava Nexus collapses into:
- a rating system
- a moderation platform
- a reputation monopoly

These are failure modes, not features.

## 8. Staged Architecture (Non-Negotiable)

### v0 — Cognitive Sandbox

Audience:
- thinkers
- writers
- Obsidian users
- people comfortable with unfinished meaning

Characteristics:
- pseudonymous or anonymous
- low-stakes
- no enforcement
- no canonical truth
- ideas over identities

Purpose:
- validate semantic objects
- test versioning and lineage
- observe how meaning clusters naturally

---

### v1 — Persistent Identity (TAMAD ID)

Purpose:
- introduce consequence without central authority
- allow memory to follow actors across contexts

Still:
- no global truth
- no reputation monopoly
- no forced finality

---

### v1.5+ — Domain Lenses

Examples:
- DAO governance
- grant review
- healthcare narratives
- rental or dispute contexts

High-stakes domains come **after** the substrate proves itself.

---

## 9. The Core Invariants

Across all versions, Guava Nexus must preserve:

- claims are not verdicts
- memory is additive, not substitutive
- similarity does not imply authority
- meaning evolves and is never finalized

These are not features.  
They are constraints.

## 10. One-Sentence Anchor

**Blockchains remember what happened.  
Guava Nexus remembers what it meant.**

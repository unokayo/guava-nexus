# Guava Nexus v0 — Non-Goals

This document defines what Guava Nexus v0 explicitly does NOT attempt to do.
Anything listed here is intentionally out of scope for the initial build.

## Not in v0

- No token issuance or tokenomics
- No incentives, rewards, or staking mechanisms
- No DAO governance or voting systems
- No AI scoring, ranking, or automated evaluation
- No social features (likes, comments, feeds, followers)
- No marketplaces or monetization
- No reputation or identity system beyond wallet address
- No plagiarism detection or arbitration
- No upgradeable or proxy smart contracts
- No handling of real economic value

## Intentional Focus of v0

Guava Nexus v0 exists only to prove that:
- a structured idea (“Seed”) can be authored,
- its existence can be anchored on a public ledger,
- its versions can be tracked over time,
- and its lineage can be verified without trusting a central authority.

Anything that does not directly serve this proof is deferred.
